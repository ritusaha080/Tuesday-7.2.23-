                <h3 class="section-title">What is Mindfulness?</h3>

                <p class="center"> Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we’re
                    doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around us.

                    While mindfulness is something we all naturally possess, it’s more readily available to us when we
                    practice on a daily basis.

                    Whenever you bring awareness to what you’re directly experiencing via your senses, or to your state
                    of mind via your thoughts and emotions, you’re being mindful. And there’s growing research showing
                    that when you train your brain to be mindful, you’re actually remodeling the physical structure of
                    your brain.</p>

                <h4 class="section-title">Meditation Instruction</h4>
                <p class="center">

                    Inner Peace Fellowship Meditation (IPF Meditation) comes from the Vedic tradition of India, which is
                    over 3,000 years old. IPF Meditation uses the same Sanskit mantras that yogis in India have been
                    using and refining for thousands of years. IPF Meditation is very easy to learn, and you can get
                    many valuable benefits from practicing it. Over one million people in 235 countries have used these
                    meditation instructions as of 2021.

                    You learn to meditate by meditating. The silence and stillness you experience in meditation and the
                    increased happiness and diminished stress you experience outside meditation are so attractive and
                    welcomed that you naturally teach yourself how to go deeper into that silence and stillness each
                    time you meditate.

                <h5 class="large-font center green">Your First Meditation</h5>
                <p class="center">To begin meditating, find a place where you can sit comfortably and quietly. Then close your eyes and
                    do nothing for a minute or so. Thoughts may come during that time, and that is okay. Then start the
                    audio below and play your mantra** at a whisper. Each time you hear your mantra, say it quietly
                    inside without moving your tongue or lips. After one minute the audio will fade to silence. Then
                    continue saying your mantra quietly inside for four more minutes. If thoughts come during that time,
                    gently return to saying your mantra quietly inside. The audio will tell you when four minutes is
                    over. Follow this instruction for your first meditation only. After your first meditation, follow
                    the instructions in the Daily Practice of Meditation section below.</p>
